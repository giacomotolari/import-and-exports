### Imports and Exports

- Default exports vs. named exports: 
  `export default`, `export {<var1>, <var2> [, ...]}`
- Namespacing imports: 
  `import <namespace> from <path>`, `import * as <namespace> from <path>`
- Destructuring imports: `import { <var1>, <var2 [, ...]} from `<path>`


## Exercise:

Browser-modules-imports-exports https://classroom.github.com/a/9O7KNxyA


Exports without a default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag are Default exports. 
Using one over the other can have effects on your code readability, file structure, and component organization. 


 ## Named Exports

 Can export multiple values
 MUST use the exported name when importing

 ## Default Exports

 Export a single value
 Can use any name when importing
